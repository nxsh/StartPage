# StartPage
Start page for web browsers with functions like weather and frequent links

## Todo
* Cycle search engines: DONE
* Set name via local storage (pressing enter collides with search function) DONE
* Isolate keypresses on page from those when in an input DONE
* Order flex settings (nav) to be last on mobile DONE

* When settings and aside are both open they cause page to extend past viewport, needs fix
* Searching for an ID in a JSON object without an explicit loop
* HARD - match IP location with a location in the Corona data JSON object to pull cases
* Vertical center for page
* Store search engine selection as a cookie/local storage
* Light mode theme toggle using cookies/local storage
* Viewport break at 641px to 1400px so that columns collapse into two rows
